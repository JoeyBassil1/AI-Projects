"""BA forced us to buy new tickets""


G Marton (United States) 4th January 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   We flew in November 2023, but it took this long to seek a satisfactory response from BA, which we ultimately never received. BA refused to re-book my son and me at no cost that day due to lack of Underground service / alternate service. BA forced us to buy new tickets and never admitted that they subjected us to disparate treatment. I will not be flying or recommending BA again.

"“staff had no sympathy or empathy”


1 reviews



Raeesa Carrim (South Africa) 3rd January 2025

✅ Trip Verified | I left for London from Johannesburg at 21:15 on 22 December 2024. My only issue with that flight was the pillows they gave us were dirty and when my 7 year old dropped some juice and I asked a cabin crew member walking past for some serviettes she told me to go to the bathroom to get some to clean it up. Those issues weren’t pleasant but certainly not a major problem. I was booked on the BA0057 at 21:15 on 31 December 2024 to return to Johannesburg. The flight was delayed to the 1 January 2025 at 12:00pm. I had a connecting flight to Durban and do not live in Johannesburg. Landing in Johannesburg with 3 children at 1 am was not an option for me. BA changed my flight to 2nd January 2025 at 18:25. I requested a sooner date so I could get home sooner. I was given 1 January 2025 at 21:15. I accepted this as this is the original time I opted for and would he most convenient for me as I was doing a connection in Johannesburg to Durban. Unfortunately this flight was delayed till 2nd January at 17:00. I was extremely upset by this as I was absolutely exhausted and had 3 children who were absolutely exhausted. I also suffer from eczema and hay fever and did not have my creams and medication. This caused my eczema to flare up so badly, even my lips were cracked and burning. My allergies were so severe that my eyes were sticking together and I couldn’t stop sneezing. My daughter also has eczema and has had a flare up. The staff had no sympathy or empathy for a mother traveling alone and her children. I was just told that they know it’s an inconvenience and a lady even snapped at me that they trying their best. My children are 4, 7 and 11 and we were all booked on separate seats. Is that even legal let alone ethical? They were refusing to help me and saying they can’t do anything. I approached 3 people, and the third person finally put us together. So they could clearly help me??? My flight from Johannesburg to Durban was originally booked on South African Airways and I paid a lot for this ticket as South African Airways is not a low cost airline. I was given a cheap low cost Airline, CemAir, which I had never even heard of, to replace my SAA flight. I suffer from flight anxiety and this is why I never book low cost airlines with tiny flights. My anxiety went through the roof on the flight! Besides all of this, I am also left with a huge credit card bill as I used up all my pounds on the 1st! I know BA is obliged to compensate me for the inconvenience under EU law but besides the compensation BA staff really needs to show more empathy for their passengers, like me, who had two hours long flight delays two days in a row and was alone with 3 children. I expect my full compensation for all of us as this has been by far the worst experience I have had traveling. All their staff kept saying is “that’s why you will get compensation.” I am now waiting to see if I get compensated as I was promised by all of their ground staff! Legally they have to under EU law, so let’s see if they put up a fight or do what is ethical and legal.

"""the seat is outdated"" 


9 reviews



J Meares (United Kingdom) 1st January 2025

✅ Trip Verified |   After an excellent flight on a 777 CPT to LHR the return was not as good. BA have moved the Business Class checkin from one end of the hall to the other at T5 for no apparent reason so a nice long walk to check in. Fast Track security was very slow (15 minutes). The indicator board suggested the South Lounge was ""half full"" but when I went it was uncomfortably full and it is still tatty as not refurbished, so I went to the B Pier lounge instead. Much better except as usual the staff are sort of trying to pack up early and have a bizarre way of refilling the food containers which involves actually removing them to the kitchen (which means they are gone a lot of the time) rather than replenishing them customer side. Very employee-centric behaviour. Time for the flight so down to the transit to take us to the C Gates. Except the transit had decided not to stop any more at the B Gates so we watched five maybe seven transits pass through without stopping. Eventually me and a group of maybe 15 other passengers of mixed ages decided to descend to the walkway and run all the way to the C Gates. We all arrived soaked in sweat - not a nice start to a long business class flight. The A380 is spacious but the seat is outdated now and in urgent need of replacement. IFE was not working and had to be rebooted. The headphone prong was bent so headphones not working. The USB port was not working. Drinks were brought out promptly. Starter (salmon) was delicious - truly excellent. Beef was tough ... I think a bad piece of meat rather than badly cooked. Wines were good. Cheese was average to good. Staff were friendly. Good night's sleep. Breakfast good. The recheck experience at JNB is a huge hassle - there is a giant screen saying ""Domestic recheck"" and a queue but when you get to the front of the queue you are told it is SAFAIR only and not for SAA, BA's local partner. What a hassle. Why aren't we warned or told this ... loads of BA passengers making the same mistake. Overall 5/10. It's the little things that would make this better: fast track actually fast track. Refurbish the South Lounge. Have food replenishment in the passenger area, not the kitchen; make sure the transits stop, even late in the evening; refurbish the A380s; ask Do & Co (who are generally excellent by the way) to monitor meat quality rigorously.

"""a national disgrace""


Scott Fletcher (United Kingdom) 17th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   On a recent flight from Cyprus BA621 on 23/11/24, the second the cabin door was closed the pilot announced we would be held on the runway for 2 hours. They know this prior and did not inform passengers until after we had boarded. The flight home took nearly 6 hours due to weather conditions, this plus 2 hours waiting. What did BA offer during this 8 hour hell flight, 3 oatmeal biscuits and 250ml of water for our family. When I went to the cabin crew to ask for more water, which I was told there wasn’t any 3 out of the 4 cabin crew were asleep in the back row seats of the aircraft BA621 on 23/11/24. This infuriated me further as I had previously asked if there were any spare seats so that my 2 year old could spread out and get some sleep if available. I was told the flight was full. After we arrived late my connecting flight had now been missed. We then queued at the connections desk in a large queue only to watch the BA staff clock off for the night in front of us. No genuine support was given to me, or my family and we were effectively abandoned by BA. I’ve tried to speak to someone, but their helpline has an automated message saying due to the number of calls (not surprised by that aspect) they cant assist me, then hang up. Tried this several times at various times. I think it’s their default message. Have raised this via their email system. Unsurprisingly been mugged off and can’t escalate until 8 weeks have passed. Like I said a national disgrace.

"""sheer neglect in keeping us informed""


William Cowie (Australia) 17th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Flight BA 0560 arrived in Rome on 11 December where ALL passengers received a SMS from BA to say that their luggage had been left in London.  My wife and I completed the required form but were in a queue for 2 hours to have it checked. BA’ s agent in Rome believe the baggage would arrive on the last flight that night (10pm) and would most likely be delivered next day. Nobody from BA in Rome Airport made contact with us to explain what happened and when bags would arrive. We finally got our luggage delivered to us at 4pm on Sunday 15 December - the day before we were due to leave Rome. During the waiting period there was no contact initiated by either BA or their Rome agents and on several occasions when we called both Rome and London help desks, we received no updates. In 34 years of travelling together this has never happened before and the sheer neglect in keeping us informed is disgusting. Sadly for BA, we will never fly with it again and will share our horror story with others and strongly encourage them to fly with another airline. I would give BA an overall rating of zero.

"""a huge disappointment""


Danilo Queiroz Palermo (United States) 14th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   This was the first time I flew British Airways, and it was a huge disappointment. While the seat is quite good, the food is very simple and the service is subpar. But not only that, Heathrow airport, their hub, is by far the worst large airport I’ve seen in Europe. When we landed in DC I had an email saying that my luggage stayed in London. This was last Wednesday. I have an AirTag so I could follow my suitcase. It came to Washington the following day, Thursday. Ever since, it’s been sitting in the airport. British offers no means of communication: the online chat is a bot. The bot tells me to call a number in England. I did. It’s another bot. When you say you have in inquiry about luggage it sends you a link via SMS and hangs up. No option to talk to a human. In the claim form they gave me there’s a local phone, which reaches a voicemail. I keep calling them (6 times today only) and leaving messages, saying that the AirTag shows the suitcase in IAD and offering to go pick it up so they don’t need to deliver it. No one replies to the voicemail. So basically I am shut out, with no luggage, no information, no customer service and no one to talk to.

"""we had to bus to the aircraft""


9 reviews



J Meares (United Kingdom) 13th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Pretty good flight but still some small things that can be improved. Check in was quick. Lounge was good - tasty food and well chosen wines. Disappointingly they had not secured a gate so we had to bus to the aircraft and it was all a hot scrum. I got the last bus to avoid the crush. Emirates, Turkish, Lufthansa, Qatar all had planes on gates ... why not BA? Penny-pinching? Then it turned out the cabin crew forgot about those on the last bus so I had to ask for a welcome drink. It came and the champagne was actually cold. Well done BA ... first time they managed to serve champagne cold in my 10 years of flying with them. Big improvement. Cabin and seat were lovely as always (I greatly prefer to the Emirates white/gold bling). Drinks service was prompt. IFE was good. Starter (trout) was OK. Main (chicken) was excellent. Cheese was sold not cold (as it should be). Wines were excellent. We were not disturbed through the night so got a good sleep on a comfy bed. Cabin was a bit too warm though for my personal preference. Was woken up (as asked) and served a tasty breakfast. Small detail - as it is impossible to get water to 100C at altitude maybe BA could warm the ceramic coffee cups so coffee retains its heat a bit longer? Pouring not quite hot coffee into a nice (but cold) china mug means it is lukewarm instantly. Off the plane in record time (2 minutes) after parking. Bags were waiting for us on the belt. Excellent work by the ground staff. Overall 8/10. Improvement points: gate not bus to the plane; don't forget passengers on the last bus or who board late (but well before pushback). Standout cabin crew member was ""Miguel"" - what a star.

"“victims of their new supper service""


P Gough (United Kingdom) 12th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified | Check in was fine, but no priority/fast track lines for security or boarding. There is only one lounge option for first class customers in Mexico City, which is the American Airlines admirals club, which is abysmal. There is a free bar, serving cheap alcohol – an awful food selection – and nowhere to shower. On board – I find the seat really comfortable. The crew were fantastic, and I’m starting to really see some consistency in the quality of their first class crew. The drink selection was fine. The food was appalling. We were the victims of their new supper service. This is basically a dinner service with a lot less options/choice. No fish/seafood options on either the starters or the mains. First choice of Main unavailable as only two had been loaded. The fillet steak, so drying and overcooked, that I heard at least three people send it back. Pretty impressive for a cabin of just eight passengers..Dreadful dessert and cheeseboard. luggage off swiftly the other end – so good to see priority tagging working.

"“flight was cancelled last minute”


L Harper (United Kingdom) 6th December 2024

✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is absolute rubbish. I had to fly to Amsterdam for an urgent appointment. The flight was cancelled last minute presumably due to bad weather. They've kept us at the gate saying the plane couldn't land while literally every plane from that airport was taking off and landing with zero issues. There was another KLM flight to Amsterdam scheduled to depart at the same time. It took off on time and another KLM flight to Amsterdam later the evening also took off without any problems. It's just the one operated by British Airways was cancelled because of 'the bad weather'. Apparently, the weather was so bad that every plane could land and take off successfully apart from theirs. I had to rebook myself on the Eurostar the next day and would still miss the important appointment that I intended to go to Amsterdam for. All thanks to British Airways.

"“Nobody wants to take responsibility”


P Shaw (United Kingdom) 2nd December 2024

✅ Trip Verified | The flight time was changed at the last minute without warning and no assistance was provided by the ground staff (3rd party agents) regarding the impact for the delay, nor was any help forthcoming from the phoneline. Nobody in the airline wants to take responsibility for anything. This is fundamentally an unreliable airline. Onboard service was poor and not even as good as some low cost airlines.

"""Terrible customer service"" 


S Warden (United Kingdom) 29th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   I'm so fraustrated. My flight was cancelled last minute, which wasn't the end of the world, even though the earliest I could get re-booked was three days later. It's the insane saga of events that proceeded to claim the compensation that I'm legally entitled to according to EU rules. Used their claims page and all was OK. It was from there that it became incomprehensibly frustrating. My case was closed but no confirmation of what the conclusion was or any money. I tried calling but kept being lead in circles; customer services can't speak to the claims team, the claims team can't be spoken to directly, customer service don't have access to the claims team's system and so on. 4 calls later and 'nothing could be done'. I had to throw my toys out of the pram on the last call and someone finally updated me. I thought that was the end; they had confirmed the claim and that I would be transferred what I was due. And then, they got the amount wrong. I wrote to they to highlight this and they said that they would rectify it. Almost 1 month since the original flight was cancelled and still haven't received what is owed to me as compensation for my wife and son. I have sent two more emails in the last two days and I've yet to get a response. It is criminal that they are not adhering to the aviation rules that dictate compensation for cancelled flights. Terrible customer service and honestly can't belive that BA are capable of such awful service.

"“Is British Airways really this cheap”


Jay Jordan (United Kingdom) 23rd November 2024

✅ Trip Verified | We have sat on this plane for an hour and forty five minutes awaiting takeoff due to bad weather in London. This is understandable for safety. Fortunately I have a long layover so this delay does not affect me. However many others are not so lucky. While waiting we were given one small bottle of water and one tiny pack of corn kernels. Later food and drink were offered for purchase. This is my complaint. After sitting idle on this plane for nearly two hours and possibly missing connecting flights they can’t give us a free bag of chips and a coke? When I asked I was told no. Is British Airways really this cheap and money grubbing?

We we told by airline employees to purchase any necessities (toiletries, refreshments, etc.) and we'd be reimbursed. That claim was denied, with BA claiming that weather was the reason for the delay (an outright lie since every other airline in London was flying on-time). We were unable to to anything besides stand in lines for vouchers, stand in lines for shuttles, stand in line for reservations, etc. for 48+ hours. It was an absolute nightmare and I will never fly BA again.

The aircraft actually left on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The cabin crew looked bored and uninspired as they can often do on BA (I read at times) but that didn’t really matter. It was a quiet flight so I say myself at the emergency exit unchallenged which was handy. Would fly again with BA where pressed.

Onboard services are also archaic and outdated and the planes are the oldest out of any airline I’ve flown with. Food and service was the worst I’ve ever experienced and I’ve travelled on most airlines (Emirates, Etihad, Thai, Malaysian, Qantas, Cathay, UA etc). DO NOT FLY WITH BA.

"“flying with BA was disappointing”


Hlynur Jónsson (Iceland) 8th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Disappointing service, plane interior and terribly incompetent customer service I booked my flight directly through BA's website. Soon after I started to get emails saying my selected seats (I paid extra for the selection) had been changed by BA without any reason given and I was directed to the website. There I found no information on the said seat change. This happened several times (I had 4 flights altogether). The website seems to be a digital dinosaur. The first leg of my flight was fine, until I discovered in the transfer area at Heathrow that I forgot my new laptop onboard. Immediately I contacted BA's so called Customer Service (what an oxymoron), which basically said they can not do anything, I would have to wait until the cleaners (working for a contractor) would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called Lost & Found at the airport. BA's customer service said they couldn't contact their colleagues in the terminal/gate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no 27A of the plane (yes I told them exactly were the laptop was). They wouldn't take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident. They simply had no interest in assisting me and didn't even make an attempt to pretend they did. Communication via their online customer service was poor, and they didn't even respond to my messages. In the end I emailed the representative at Heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor (which did not reveal his name): ""It is not the duty of British Airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers, however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback."" They took no responsibility and referred me to Smartecarte, which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items at Heathrow. I have not received the laptop, worth 2 thousand GBP, back now 3 weeks later. The flights between London and Cape Town (~12 hours), were unpleasant. The flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job, it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal, which also was distributed extremely slowly. Food was not good. Boarding was slow and inefficient. Drinks were only offered twice (otherwise you'd have to ask for it especially) on this long flights. The seats were of fabric, uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep. All in all flying with British Airways was disappointing and I will not be keen on flying with them again.

When we reach Iceland I emailed British Airways telling then she won't be using her return ticket and requested for a partial refund. 2 days later. I received an email from customer service that I need to contact one of their service centres via the provided link. I replied to say the link only goes to a page with various British landline phone numbers to call and explained that I am overseas then and it will not be practical to do this via international calls. They replied to say I can only do this by contacting the service centres. So the airline end up taking my money regardless.

"""the same as low cost carriers"" 


Michael Asher (Turkey) 7th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   I was surprised to receive confirmation pre-flight that I had 69 kgs luggage allowance. This to be later confirmed as one at 23 kg checked in, another 23 kgs carry on for under seat, and a third 23 kgs carry on for overhead stowage. Checkin opened a bit late, and the line for Executive Club members even later, but was courteous and efficient. Long queue for passport control but the fault of Brexit, not BA. My seat had no screen; no earphone socket; no charge point; no seat recline; no boarding music. All the same as low cost carriers. Captain announced ""Wonderful service from Emily and crew"" - maybe it was in Club Class, not the economy cabin. It was announced that they would serve complimentary water and snack, but only the snack came. It was also announced there would be free text messaging for Exec Club members, but I couldn't get it to work, although a member. Snacks were sold, some at twice TUI price. For example Cadbury's chocolate fingers at £3.50. I chose BA this time as when I booked it was cheaper than all the charter carriers. And being British I mustn't forget BA's impeccable safety record and normally reliable service. After landing the Purser thanked the crew for their hard work. Seems pushing one small cart down the aisle during four hours constitutes hard work in BA. But at least we were on time.

"“A very poor experience”


Kunal Purohit (India) 5th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   I had visa issues, and hence, was debarred from flying. The ground staff at Mumbai was excellent (a woman named Brinelle) was very helpful and understanding. I had to rebook my tickets, and while the original journey was consisting of 3 legs, BA forced me to rebook the entire ticket, because their system did not allow them to rebook just that one leg (even though there was a gap of 13 days between the two legs, not like they were connecting flights). The telephone operator was rude, took 45 minutes and kept saying she needed 3-4 more minutes to give me clarity. It was horrendous. The final price they offered me for rebooking 2 of the 3 legs was much more than the original fare for all 3 legs. She was torturous, BA was horrendous because the website does not allow you to do all this. A very poor experience, in all.

"""food and beverages being targeted"" 


E Smyth (United Kingdom) 5th November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Singapore to Heathrow with BA. Two choices on this route A380 or 777-300. In economy and premium (and first) there isn’t much in it. In club world the 777 wins as it has the suite. Check in was easy. Security and passport control in Singapore is efficient. Choice of 3 lounges (BA, Qantas or Qatar) the latter wins easily. BA lounge was ok no major negatives. Qantas wins on space. Boarding was on time. The aircraft has a high density club world cabin. Service was fine. Club suite was good. It’s the food and beverages that are being targeted I feel. The 1st meal starter was good, main of beef fillet was average, same sentiment for cheese. Wines were acceptable. Champagne choice is cheap so I did not try. Service for meals efficient given the full cabin. Breakfast was similar. The menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert, for this to work for BA, a major shift in how lounge options are sourced and presented would be needed. As it was I slept well, we arrived early, luggage off quickly (for once) so a reasonable flight overall. My warning to BA is that food and beverages in club world are drifting in the wrong direction

"""never fly with them again""


Erika Greyling (United Kingdom) 3rd November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   I recently travelled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes. Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance. After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldn’t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes. When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next time—ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place! This experience cost us a staggering £682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing. British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. I will never fly with them again, and I urge others to consider alternative airlines.

"""still have not heard any updates""


S Wozniak (United States) 3rd November 2024

Not Verified |  I paid for seats 80 A and B on my flight from Heathrow to Boston on the A380, paying for premium economy seats. Upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said I was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old I presume (65) since there is no other reason I can find I could not sit in the exit seating. I am healthy enough to walk 10-12 miles a day and have adequate upper body strength. Attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat, at the rear of the aircraft, second floor and in the middle two seats of the row. We were told our money would be refunded immediately for the ""inconvenience"". After several weeks I recontacted BA and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section. 6 weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in 3 weeks, keep waiting. The plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair. They completed that 30 minutes later and boarded the flight. The captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another 30 minutes. We were not able to make up for the lost time in the air. We landed 1.5 hours later than scheduled, wreaking havoc with our next flight.

It was hard to operate in the dark as the touch screen wasn’t working at times. There was though a remote. The cabin crew slamming air larders (ovens and draws). Apart from that, the cabin crew were nice, the food was good and the seat was comfortable.

"""support staff wash their hands of you"" 


Charlotte Parsons (United Kingdom) 2nd November 2024

✅ Trip Verified |  I decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to World Traveller Plus on the return leg of our Canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. I hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because I had assumed I would be enjoying the entertainment BA had promised. So I decided to lie back and get some rest instead, only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. The flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when I had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (I have a bad lower back). Early on in this experience I asked to be moved to economy so that I could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. The apologetic flight attendant assured me I would receive compensation, which I assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew BA, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of World Traveller Plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance). BA's actual compensation offer: £25 worth of Avios points each. I wrote back (since BA doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds I'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. They then ghosted me. My experience is a cautionary tale about British Airways customer support. If all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant World Traveller Plus experience. But if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. So unless you're prepared to gamble, I would advise you to either stick with Economy/World Traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from A to B, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. Or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. If your flight is to Canada, I would recommend an airline such as Air Canada, which I turned to during the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. They do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-Covid, I started flying BA again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important. I now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy - one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds.

"""Who can trust BA to travel2


J C Albrecht (United Kingdom) 31st October 2024

Not Verified |  The flight scheduled at 1840 left 2hours 40 minutes alter due to late arrival of incoming aircraft from Naples, as a result I missed a connection from Istanbul to Dubai, Nothing unusual. The issue acknowledged by the captain is that the plane had been late since the morning flight from Rome with rolling effect until the evening. As this was the case, whey did BA not contact me and all other passengers, I could have made other arrangements and fly early to Istanbul and not miss my connection resulting in a £300 charge and a long delay. BA has certainly lots of staff who could have informed by using the email or text. Obviously passengers are of no utility to BA once the ticket is purchased. Who can trust BA to travel?

✅ Trip Verified |   I have been flying BA for over 15 years. I was an American Airlines FF and gave it up for BA. I am a Gold member on BA and have been for over 10 years. Here are the things I have noticed over the last 5 years on BA. the Flight attendants are getting lazier and complacent, from cleaning bathrooms to serving meals. The food on BA has deteriorated to the point of not being able to eat the garbage they give you and having gold status is almost meaningless in the big scheme of things. I have NEVER been able to upgrade to business or first using the AVIOS points I have accumulated on a transcon flight. I fly BA now because its the only partner of American Airllines that I can easily get to europe. I have switched back to AA FF program and is already so much better. BA used to be a splendid airline and now its just another poor airline in the european market!

"""spent two hours trying to make contact with BA""

Paul Mercer (United Kingdom) 25th October 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   On arriving at Mexico Airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from LHR was about six hours late. When we eventually managed to check in we told that – contrary to the BA website – we could not have access to the 24-hour Grand Lounge Elite and instead would use the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left. After that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher. Two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to Cancun because of a “volcanic ash cloud over Mexico City” – although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from Europe. They eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at 1.30am. We were assured that we would all be on a BA flight leaving the same time the following day. The only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel. He said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details. (When we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared.) During the night, we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an Air Canada flight leaving at 6.30am. This would have been impossible with such short notice and without Canadian EPA authorisation. We then spent two hours trying to make contact with BA – its Mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an Aeromexico flight in economy. They told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra £200 for the seats. Later, after a very long call, we were told that we could be upgraded to business with Aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability. BA then informed us that because we had already checked in – as they had suggested – we could not be moved and this took three more calls to Aeromexico to sort out. I totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers. We were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the UK but others – such as a disabled lady – had been told nothing when we left.

"""using another airline for future travel""


M Stansfield (United States) 24th October 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   I have flown British Airways for many years and still do so regularly. In one of my last flights this past summer between Paris and Boston, British booked me on a connecting flight between Paris and London that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in London. London Heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals. So already, one is pressed for time. My flight from Paris to London that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact. BA Flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. – don’t bother with this one. Flight Connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that I was rushing to the gate. It was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart. I ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane. The agent said that since no one knew where I was (false) the plane left without me – early. Gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay. So I made the 20 minute trek back to Flight Connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. I was now going to miss the wedding I was destined to attend in Boston. They sent me to a prepaid Hilton hotel room for the night but told me that I would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there. They gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement. This was in early July. It took me 4 months and a complaint to the British Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77. There was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight I won’t ever take with British. Like a bad insurance claim, British just kept denying my claim, expecting that I would just go away. Well, I am going away. I’m taking my $77 and using another airline for future travel.

"“BA’s petty penny pinching ”


36 reviews



Paul Mercer (United Kingdom) 12th October 2024

✅ Trip Verified | British Airways charge you for the pleasure of choosing your seat and I had been put at the very back of Club which turned out to be an advantage because it meant I could get to the seat without having to climb over anybody. The seat was clean but as I later discovered that the foldout section would not stay up and your feet dangled over the edge when the bed was extended. After boarding was complete we were told that departure was delayed because BA had not loaded all of the cargo; we were then told that it was delayed further because there was a fault with one of the fuel pumps. It took over five hours for this problem to be corrected as the pilot later informed us that they installed new pump having initially thought that it was a software issue. During that time we were served the meal but were told that alcohol is not permitted which was curious given that we had already been served a pre-departure drink. Most of the cabin crew were male and, apparently, based in Mexico and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise given that those I spoke to were incredibly positive and friendly but seemed embarrassed at what was happening. I knew that it was the old-style seats but what was less acceptable is BA’s petty penny pinching. If there was a competition for the smallest hot towel BA would be the winner. The food sounded nice and looked impressive but seemed totally tasteless.

✅ Trip Verified | What is wrong with you guys? People pay lots of money for a business class ticket but you sit squeezed into a seat with no legroom, nothing is clean, the overhead lockers are empty and they want you to put your bag under the seat so that you have no room for your legs anymore and then serve you food that is just rubbish. The staff demonstrates it's British arrogance with no manners. There is no decent polite service anymore. There is really no difference to easyjet at all. It's the same on their European routes.

"""crew were all very friendly""

James Tapley (United Kingdom) 8th October 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   I recently flew from New York back to London with BA, this wasn't my first long haul with them however it was my first time travelling in World Traveler Plus. We boarded the aircraft on time and stress free and my first impression was good. The cabin was clean and the leg room was good. The recline on the seat was generous and combined with a footrest it was quite comfortable. Waiting on our seats was a decent quality cushion and blanket as well as an amenity kit. The amenity kit contained some good headphones, socks, an eye mask, lip balm, pen and toothbrush and toothpaste. Once boarding was complete we were offered a pre departure drink with orange juice, water or champagne being the options. The crew were all very friendly and professional and did their upmost to ensure that everyone was happy. Once in the air we were offered a hot towel and another round of drinks, this time with a lot more selection. Drinks were offered several times throughout the flight. A menu was also handed out not long after take off, the starter was quinoa and for main there was a choice of chicken, meatballs and pasta or a vegetarian mushroom dish. I chose the meatballs and they were really good. My only real complaint about the flight was people not getting the dish they wished for. We were sat in the last row of the premium economy cabin and by the time the meal service got to us all of the chicken dishes were gone. The moral of the story is that if you sit at the front of the cabin, you will likely get your preferred meal option. After the meal I chose to watch some shows on the well sized entertainment screen, BA is definitely up there for best inflight entertainment. Finally about an hour before landing we were served a breakfast snack, this come in the form of a warm egg and swiss cheese bagel. It was edible but also a little soggy and didn't really taste of much, I certainly wont be craving one anytime soon. We touched down into Heathrow on time before disembarking the aircraft and picking up our bags, everything was very efficient and we were on our way in no time.

"""Simply not good enough"" 


James Wills (United Kingdom) 6th October 2024

Not Verified |   BA business class in Europe has a seat the same as economy, you simply have an empty seat next to you and so for many, the only true benefits are in flight meals, lounge access and priority security etc. The problem on this flight was a small child, aged around five, who sang incessantly in an extremely loud voice throughout most of the flight. I am aware of the difficulties of flying with children, I know it is difficult to keep them entertained etc, I am a patient person, I have headphones. The parents of this child chose, despite a polite request, not to try and quieten their child at all. At this point one had an expectation the crew will step in. If I was singling loudly, disrupting other passengers, they would quite rightly ask me to desist. So why not speak to the parents of a child who is doing the same and disrupting the rest and sleep of other passengers? Instead, having served the meal, the crew retreated behind their curtain and left the passengers to stew. Simply not good enough. As for WiFi? Forget it...

"“BA refuses to reimburse us”


L James (United States) 5th October 2024

✅ Trip Verified | Our flight started in Seattle Wa heading to Lisbon Portugal. After a 10 hour flight and a 2 hour layover we boarded flight BA502 to Lisbon. After heading to the runway the plane stopped and the pilot said we have a small mechanical issue and a mechanic is in route. After an hour in the tarmac the flight crews announce they were going to offer complimentary WATER? Really!! Another half hour goes by and they say the flight is cancelled, no reason at that time. As we wait for a bus to remove all passengers from the plane they announce that there will be staff members back at the gate to help with meal vouchers, taxi rides and hotel accommodations. WHAT? We get off the bus and there is a line of passengers trying to figure out what’s happening. Staff hands my wife and I a $10 meal voucher and says go upstairs and someone will help you with your issues. We go upstairs and nobody knows what to do. One staff member hands us a paper for a hotel room and tells us to get your luggage and keep your receipt for the taxi to be reimbursed. Nothing else. I asked about another flight and she said they will contact you asap. Who will contact?? And she walked away. We grabbed our luggage and headed to the taxi line. As we are being driven to the hotel I receive an email for our flight the next day on a different airline, Iberian? Our assigned seats are not together?? We get to the hotel and I barely fit into the shower and a double bed. I’m 6’3” 230lbs and with my wife. Crazy. Get a little sleep nothing to eat until the am. Another taxi ride to the airport and tried to use our meal vouchers but they were only good for the prior day. Went to the first customer service line and he didn’t have the authorization to issue new vouchers. Finally after the third customer service line we had someone issue us new vouchers. Finally made it to our destination a day in half later and still had to pay for our room that we didn’t even use because of the cancellation. BA refuses to reimburse us for that first night we missed. Filed a claim with BA and nothing so far. We will never fly BA again!

"""my luggage is missing""


Biswajit Mohanty (India) 4th October 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   British Airways Flight from Edinburgh got delayed by 1 h 30 Min and there was a connecting flight part of same ticket. So I have literally run for next connecting flight of British Airways from LHR to Delhi. As a bonus trouble to my surprise when I landed in Delhi I got to know that my luggage is missing. I was assured there that my luggage will be delivered to my address but today 4th Oct I have not received it yet. They have shown my luggage at BBi air port and I have to apply leave so that I can collect it. No details point of contact, how to enter air port without ticket. All sort of trouble I have to face.

"""work is needed to provide a better customer experience""


5 reviews



Christopher Neep (United Kingdom) 28th September 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   British Airways World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) product needs some improvement to justify the high cost over economy. Yes, the seat and leg room are far superior and on this flight, the crew were excellent. However, lunch/dinner was only average, wine selection was poor and like some other airlines, BA provides a revolting snack prior to landing. (The same snack is served in economy). Choice of entertainment also requires improvement. If CEO Sean Doyle is serious about elevating BA to one one of the world’s best airlines (which it once was) then work is needed to provide a better customer experience.

"""barely a step above low cost airlines""


D Hane (United Kingdom) 25th September 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   BA is barely a step above low cost airlines. They try to dime and nickel everywhere possible. I now found out that you cannot select a seat a check in anymore when you have no baggage. Next time I go with low cost carrier since there is virtually no difference anymore.

"""Happy with the flight crew""


John Brown (United States) 24th September 2024

Not Verified |  Happy with the flight crew. Hadn't been on a plane in 20 years and was stressed out. They made it comfortable for me and I want to say thank you to the flight crew for helping me relax. If I go back to France again, I'm going British Airways.

"""seats are super uncomfortable"" 


C Haddei (Morocco) 22nd September 2024

✅ Trip Verified |   Horrible service from boarding to landing. I flew from London to Marrakech and was very disappointed with the arrangement for boarding, my food is horrible, the staff are arrogant to me and the seats are super uncomfortable for a 3h40min flight business class. Today taking the flight from Marrakech to London. I do not recommend.

"""very disappointed"" 


Thomas Wilson (United States) 13th September 2024

Not Verified |  My wife and I are very disappointed with flying on British Airways. Our flight on 9/12 was cancelled while all other airlines were flying. In addition, our seats changed multiple times without any explanation. The people working were very rude and not at all customer oriented.

"""happily recommend and use BA"" 


Stephen Cooper (Australia) 13th September 2024

Not Verified |  We flew BA between Heathrow and Berlin one way connection. Our experience with BA ground staff at Heathrow was very good, friendly and helpful at check in and baggage drop off. The crew on our flight were also very good, Captain provided some general information and welcoming in a suitable casual but efficient way. Flight stewards were also very friendly and handed out some water and small snack (chocolate bar) unexpected on a 1 hr 20 min flight. Seating was typical for class of aircraft and ticket. Cleanliness was not optimal and could be improved. From memory a slightly delayed departure from Heathrow, which was slightly reduced on arrival at Berlin. This was not an issue for us as Berlin was our destination with no connecting concerns. Our baggage arrived safely at Berlin. I understand BA has had some very negative reviews by customers but our experience on this occasion was very positive and would happily recommend and use BA.

"""cannot get compensation for our flight""


S Grimsditch (United Kingdom) 13th September 2024

Not Verified |  Absolutely disgusted with BA. Our flights were cancelled on 1 May by BA even though the flight still departed. We had a connecting flight from Manchester to Heathrow which was cancelled due to weather so could not get compensation for that flight. But now it turns out we cannot get compensation for our flight to Seattle either even though BA actually cancelled it for us. I will never fly with them again.

"“Crew very friendly and attentive”


Mark Simons (United Kingdom) 11th September 2024

Not Verified | Took a trip to Nashville with my wife for a leisure break. Arrived at T5 and directed to the Club World check in zone to the left of the terminal. Zone seemed way too small for the number of passengers and the check in process was painfully slow. Queues for non premium cabins seemed to be much more effectively managed. Had a bite to eat at the departures lounge. Plenty of food options even though it was very busy. Flight departed from the furthest away satellite gate in C annex. Boarding was managed efficiently. I was in seat 4A in the Club Suites section. Lots of space and comfortable. Crew were + 40 on average and very friendly and attentive. I chose a salmon dish and was glad I was in 3A as they had run out by row 4! Entertainment was a little disappointing in terms of latest release movies. Meal prior to landing was not to my taste so I skipped it. Flight landed right on schedule so no complaints on that basis.

"""A nightmare journey""


B Owen (United Kingdom) 8th September 2024

Not Verified |  A nightmare journey courtesy of British Airways. Our worst flight experience in over 50 years of flying!  We were booked on BA470 scheduled to depart Heathrow at 12.05 on 5 Sept - we boarded 1.5 hrs late because despite the plane being at the gate we had to wait for a crew to arrive. Approximately 1hr into the flight the pilot advised that as the weather radar wasn't working, we would be returning to Heathrow where we circled for approx 45 mins before landing. There was no member of staff present to offer advice about an alternative flights and the customer service desk stated they would not deal with it but we had to await an email. An email finally arrived after about an hour and my husband and I were fortunate enough to be allocated seats on the 21.15 flight. This time we boarded approx 2 hrs late again the plane was at the gate but we had to wait for a crew. As a result it was around 3.00 am before we reached Venice and the long wait for taxis meant that we didn't reach out hotel beyond Mestre until 4.00 am. We've since learnt that BA have cancelled hundreds of flights over the past several days claiming 'bad weather' yet according to FlightRadar 24 no other airline flying out of Heathrow cancelled flights
